# realtimebus

This project is my first time working with asynchronous code. Overlaying the different stops with markers on a map of a bus that travels between MIT and Harvard. It works through mapbox.


<h2>How to run</h2>
Clone the repository into your local code editor.
Go to MapBox and get an API Token, in mapanimation.js fille, replace mapboxgl.accessToken = "THIS VALUE"; with your own API token
Open the index.html file
Right click and select 'Open Default browser' to open the project in your default browser.

<h2>Roadmap of future improvements</h2>
Implement GPS tracking and use that to account for the time interval from the bus moving from one spot to the next in order to have it be real time data<br>
